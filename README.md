# Introduction
**SSVM** is a high performance, hardware optimal Wasm Virtual Machine for AI and Blockchain applications.


# Getting Started

## Get Source Code

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:second-state/SSVM.git
$ cd SSVM
$ git checkout 0.2.0
```

## Prepare environment

### Use our docker image

Our docker image use `ubuntu 18.04` as base.

```bash
$ docker pull hydai/ssvm-dev:0.2.0
```

### Or setup the environment manually

```bash
$ sudo apt install -y \
	cmake \
	g++ \
	libboost-all-dev
```

## Build SSVM

SSVM provides various tools to enabling different runtime environment for optimal performance.
After the build is finished, you can find there are two ssvm binaries:

1. `ssvm` is for general wasm runtime.
2. `ssvm-evm` is for Ewasm runtime.
3. `ssvm-qitc` is for AI application, supporting ONNC runtime for AI model in ONNX format.

```bash
# After pulling our ssvm-dev docker image
$ docker run -it --rm \
    -v <path/to/your/ssvm/source/folder>:/root/ssvm \
    hydai/ssvm-dev:0.2.0
(docker)$ cd /root/ssvm
(docker)$ mkdir -p build && cd build
(docker)$ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DBUILD_TESTS=ON .. && make
```

## Run built-in tests

The following built-in tests are only avaliable when the build flag `BUILD_TESTS` sets to `ON`.

Users can use these tests to verify the correctness of SSVM binaries.

```bash
$ cd <path/to/ssvm/build_folder>
$ cd test/regression
$ ./ssvmRegressionTests
$ cd ../loader
$ ./ssvmLoaderEthereumTests
$ ./ssvmLoaderFileMgrTests
$ ./ssvmLoaderWagonTests
$ cd ../ast/load
$ ./ssvmASTLoadTests
$ cd ../../evm
$ ./ssvmEVMTests
```

## Run ssvm-evm (SSVM with Ewasm runtime)

To run SSVM with Ewasm bytecode, you will need to provide a valid Ewasm bytecode and the calldata.
Currently, SSVM doesnâ€™t support ABI encoding for Ethereum, so users need to compose the calldata by theirselves.

SSVM-EVM will take 3 parameters:

1. Ewasm bytecode file (`/path/to/your/ewasm/file`)
2. Call data in hex string format (`4e6ec2..000054`)
3. Gas limit (`100000`)

### Example: ERC20 token contract

In this example, we create an ERC20 token contract and compile it into Ewasm bytecode by SecondState [SOLL](https://github.com/second-state/soll) compiler.
You can find this Ewasm file(`ethereum/erc20.wasm`) in the same folder of ssvm-evm.

#### With enough gas limit (Expect execution succeeded)

```bash
# cd <path/to/ssvm/build_folder>
$ cd tools/ssvm-evm
# Usage: ./ssvm-evm wasm_file.wasm call_data_in_string_format gas_limit
$ ./ssvm-evm ethereum/erc20.wasm 4e6ec24700000000000000000000000012345678901234567890123456789012345678900000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000064 100000

## Run ssvm (SSVM with general wasm runtime)

To run SSVM with general wasm runtime, users will need to provide the following parameters:

1. Wasm file(`/path/to/wasm/file`)
2. (Optional) Entry function name, default value is `main`
3. (Optional) Argument List, can be one or more arguments.

### Example: Fibonacci

```bash
# cd <path/to/ssvm/build_folder>
$ cd tools/ssvm
# ./ssvm wasm_file.wasm [exported_func_name] [args...]
$ ./ssvm examples/fibonacci.wasm fib 10
 Info: Start running...
